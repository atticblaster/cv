        <h1>X (2022) Review:-</h1>
            <p>The movie starts with a grisly scene with an officer stepping through a bloody door. There is a hatchet burried on the porch - I think this symbolises that "the job" is done.
                There is a preacher on TV warnign about the devil. The officers go downstairs and see something that is not shown. Drugs come next - cocaine to be specific.
                A stripclub in Houston and on the mural outside it it shows a topless babe with a crocodile removing her bikini bottom. There are also birds in the mural. THis might mean something.
                 The strip clib is in an industrial area. The year is 1979 - this might mean that sex has now become an industry after being more conservative in the past.
            </p>
            <p>In the van they look at the next porno script and discuss the American dream - that you are entitled to go after whatever it is you desire. Also one of then actresses mentions that she might as
                well show off what God have given her. A closeup of a rooster. It might mean something. The main actress wants to be very famous and is told that she has that "X" factor.
                The preacher on TV says that God is forgiving but <em>every man has his limits</em> the scene then goes to a field of cows. I think that the cows represent humans for a reason I have yet to identify.
            </p>
            <p>They arrive at their place - it seems secluded. Lots of open space. The homeowner holds them at gunpoint - he seems to have forgotten that he rented the house.
